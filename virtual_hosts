let's talk about virtual hosts in apache web-server

##Apache virtual hosts##

features:
1. Multiple web-sites, per one host (physical or virtual)
2. IP-based (distinct IP per host)
3. Name-based: HTTP1.1 - request supplies desired target site

	a. shares resources (of IPs) more efficiently

Task:

1. Explore defaults
	<VirtualHost *:80> - matches 'Listen' and(or) 'NameVirtualHost' directives in ports.conf file(for debian-based apache2 installations).

Note: ensure that Name resolution is properly configured for NameBased hosting

2. IP-based Host
	a.'Listen IP:Port' - socket
	b. Match the above socket to  Virtual Host container

3. Name-based Host
	a. 'Listen:Port' - socket
	b. 'NameVirtualHost'
	c. 'ServerName FQDN'
Note: Post first site, the above directives are important to distinguish sites within apache2 web-server
Note: if you stuck with some troubles like all sites serving the same content you should check 'default' settings in sites-available directory
