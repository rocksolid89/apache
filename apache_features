there will be introductory material for apache web server

Spawn processes and|or can be dynamically:
	-expanded (увеличены)
	-contracted (сокращены)
Modular support (extensible):
	-mod_ssl (https) -  TLS (client-browser-server)
	-mod_asis - raw delivery of http documents - contains full http header info (contain full header info)
	-mod_alias - url mapping to various locations in the file system space
Common Gateway interface (CGI)
Content derivation - MIME
	mod_mine - file suffix - content type is mapped to file suffix
	mod_mime_magic - header bytes in file 
Content negotiation  - i.e. language support - provides the client with the appropriate language base content

Content compression - mod_deflate - using gzip (help with scaling sites to large user-base)

Note: splits the processing more equitably of content between server and alleviates intermediary pipes

Manipulate environmental variables based on the http requests - 'setenvif'
Note: own environmental variables for each connection
Note: apache VAR drive communications between http client -> http server

User Directories - i.e. $HOME/www facilitates broader publishing of content outside of standard DocumentRoot

Apache standard logging:
	access - default hits | misses | etc
	error - misses | server errors
Apache forensic logging
	2-entries per request
	includes ful header request
Redirections (http standards)

URL rewriting - mod_rewrite - i.e force ssl access for specific content areas
	supports regular expressions, conditions, stacks, etc.

Distributed authoring and versioning (WebDAV)

Reverse proxy server - facilitates front end filtering 

Authentication
	basic - clear text
	digest 
	PAM
	DBM
	MySQL PostgreSQL

Infinite scalability  
	load balancing of nodes
	reverse proxying

Load balancing - modular

Multi platform support

Virtual hosts:
	namebased
	ip-based
