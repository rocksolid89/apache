##Apache Socket Bindings##

Features:
	1. IPv[46]:Port -> Sockets
	2. Default Bind to ALL addresses and port 80
	3. Facilitates virtual hosting
		a. Bindings are tagged to virtual host containers
	4. 'Listen' - key directive
	Note: grep -i listen  - across Apache config files to determine where applicable. On Debian based systems, check 'ports.conf' config file.
	Note: netstat -ntlp | grep -i apache
Task:
1. Explore Defaults
	a. ports.conf
	'NameVirtualHost *:80' - facilitates bounded VirtualHosts, including the default virtual host: /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default
	<VirtualHost *:80>
2. Bind to alternate ports
	a. To add new port for listen
		in ports.conf - add new directive 'Listen 8080'
				include 'NameVirtualHost *:8080'
		in directory ../sites-enabled/..
				create new file which will be serve our new virtual host

Note: ifconfig eth0:1 ip-address/mask - will add virtual network interface (with another ip address) for our system
      ifconfig eth0:1 del ip-address - remove virtual interface

Note: ensure that additional addresses are bound to the network interface prior to reload of Apache, otherwise, Apache may fail to load
